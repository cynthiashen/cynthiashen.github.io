				Hi, I'm Cynthia! I grew up in Cupertino, graduated from UC Berkeley, and now live in San Francisco (so you could definitely say I'm a Bay Area girl).

				<br>

				<br> I love cooking, yoga, math, trivia, crosswords, and biking! I'm also a full time software engineer who is trying to put together this website with minimal front end experience, so we'll see how this goes.</div>
